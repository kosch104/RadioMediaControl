# Radio Media Control
This mod allows you to use the ingame radio control to control playback and volume of your local media. This includes Spotify, Youtube, and other media players.

### -> [Full Changelog](https://github.com/kosch104/RadioMediaControl/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## Features
- Play/Pause
- Volume Control (Controls your system volume, not that of the media player)
- Next/Previous

## Feature roadmap
- I might look into integrating actual third party media players (like spotify with playlist selection), but I can't promise anything.
