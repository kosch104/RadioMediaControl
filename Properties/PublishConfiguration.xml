# Radio Media Control (Beta)
This mod allows you to use the ingame radio control to control playback and volume of your local media. This includes Spotify, Youtube, and other media players.

## Beta Disclaimer
This mod is in the first beta version. There are some known issues you can find at the end of the page. Please report any other issues you find by creating an issue on the Github Page.

## Features
- Play/Pause
- Volume Control (Controls your system volume, not that of the media player)
- Next/Previous

## Feature roadmap
- I might look into integrating actual third party media players (like spotify with playlist selection), but I can't promise anything.

## Acknowledgment
Many people helped me in the creation of this mod. Especially I would like to thank
* **CityRat** for custom icons
* **Triton Supreme** for Extended Radio
* **89-pleasure** for helping me with the very first steps of modding.

## Known Issues
- The volume control is not very precise. This is due to the way the volume is controlled. I will try to improve this in the future
- When leaving the pause menu, the PC volume will be set to 0
- The Play/Pause buttons visuals are not updated correctly, but the functionality still works
